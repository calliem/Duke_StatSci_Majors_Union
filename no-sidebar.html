            <p><b>What is the Statistical Science Majors Union?</b><br>We are a group of statistics majors who aim to strengthen academic and social ties among undergraduates interested in statistics, pursuing a major or minor in statistics, and faculty.</p>
            <p><b>What is the Statistical Science Majors Union doing this year?</b><br>Our main objectives are to supplement the academic experience of statistics majors at Duke and to promote interest in the field of staitsitcs. We will be hosting informational sessions for first year students about the major and what it can offer them, at Duke and beyond. We will also host informal events to bridge the gap between upper level statistics students and those are just starting out, with the goal of sharing knowledge on the statistics curriculum and major or minor declarations.</p><p>Thanks for your interest, and enjoy the resources available on the site!</p>
